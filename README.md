# NinjaMustDie-Official-Documentation-Discord-Bot-Outdated-

I was the main developer for the Discord Bot of NinjaMustDie. Unfortunately, due to internal conflicts, I have quit the team some time ago, quit the game, and left the server. I don't know the current status of the bot(and if its still up or not), but this is the last version that I made before leaving the team.

ALl this work and they've only paid me a one time payment of 3000 jades... and thats after me keep being on their tail about it. Like bro their Discord mods don't even do anything and they get paid more, and they get paid MONTHLY!?
They have limited events in Discord where you submit pictures/sentences/etc for rewards. THE MODS COUNT THEM BY HAND. OVER TEN THOUSAND MESSAGES EACH EVENT, BY HAND. I told them I could automate it with the bot. The mods said "No, because we get a bonus for counting/organizing the event participation", even though it takes them like a week each event while I could make it happen in like one minute... and that's because of Discord's rate limits.
The mods are honestly so bad, I got framed for "Raiding the server"(I pushed a bug to prod of this bot and it send ONE, ONLY ONE message in every channel(okay thats my bad), but like how is that "raiding" the server?? If I wanted to raid the server I could've nuked it with the bot's admin privilege ðŸ’€)...None of the mods do anything, they're salty and double-standard as heck, and are just mostly overall pricks.

Anyways thats my little rent and history with the game, I guess
